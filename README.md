# Data-Driven-Insights-on-Patient-No-Shows
Why do 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments? A person makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and no-show. Who to blame?

# 📊 Data-Driven Insights on Patient No-Shows

This project explores the phenomenon of patient absenteeism in medical appointments through data analysis. Using a real-world dataset, the analysis dives into identifying key patterns, understanding potential causes, and applying statistical methods to uncover valuable insights that can help healthcare providers reduce no-show rates.

## 🔍 Project Overview (P-20250523)

Patients missing scheduled appointments is a widespread issue in healthcare systems. This project aims to:

- Clean and preprocess real-world data with formatting inconsistencies (e.g. non-standard separators, missing headers, strange decimal formats, etc.)
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual tools like boxplots, histograms, and frequency plots
- Handle missing data, detect duplicates (explicit and implicit), and manage categorical and quantitative variables
- Perform probability analysis on dependent, independent, and mutually exclusive events
- Model and interpret binomial and normal distributions
- Conduct statistical hypothesis testing to assess significant patterns
